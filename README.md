# Smart Water Level Indicator 🚰

## 💡 Problem Statement
Manual monitoring of water tanks leads to overflow or empty tanks.

## 🎯 Objective
Automated detection of water level using Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) and Arduino Uno.

## 🧰 Components
- Arduino Uno
- Ultrasonic Sensor
- LEDs / Buzzer
- Jumper wires, Breadboard

## ⚙️ Working
The ultrasonic sensor measures distance to the water. Based on the distance:
- Green: Low level
- Yellow: Medium

- Red + Buzzer: High/Overflow
